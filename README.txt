Screenstuck

Introduction

Screenstuck is a C++ program that checks if there is a new update on the webcomic Homestuck, created by Andrew Hussie. Upon starup, Screenstuck asks the user for a refresh rate (in minutes). It then checks the Homestuck RSS feed every specified amount of minutes for a new update. If there is an update, an image, of your choosing, pops-up on the top-right side of your screen.
